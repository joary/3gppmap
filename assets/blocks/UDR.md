# UDR - Unified Data Repository:


Unique database that stores all the user data.


Traditionally these data were stored by HSS (for LTE) or HLR (for GSM/WCDMA).
In order to unify these entities, a single data repository is used (UDR) with different front-ends.
For example HSS can be substituted by HSS-FE a front-end to the UDR database.

Here a list of the front-ends:

- HSS - Home Subscriber Service
- HLR - Home Location Register
- AuC - Authentication Center
- ASs - Application Servers
